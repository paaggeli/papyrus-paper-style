# Ancient paper-papyrus texture background 

I created this Ancient Paper Texture using ComfyUI and followed this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIvWdmqVx6E) on how to create patterns and tiles.

This papyrus-style texture was specifically created for my upcoming project, [Tartarus Insight](https://tartarusinsight.com/), which I'm building in public. If you're interested in following along with the process, feel free to [check out!](https://x.com/PanosAngel1)

Feel free to use this texture in your own projects as well!
